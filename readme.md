# Reset CSS property's to default value
> first import css file to your head
`  <link rel="stylesheet" href="default_value.css">`
then add `defaultValue` class to your html element to reset it and his childes to default value
# Example :
` <div class="defaultValue"></div>` 
# When should you use this file ?
if you work on third party content and design like google ads and you do not want
 to use iframe this file will work fine and dont allow sites to replace your css code
